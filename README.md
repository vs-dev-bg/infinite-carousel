# infinite-carousel
  Infinite carousel/slider

  This is dummy project which shows infinite slider (carousel) with animations, implemented only with pure css.
  There are no javascript animations. You can select number of tabs that you can move. 
  Then you can move the containers to the left or to the right infinitley.
  The logic is smart and you can have for example minimum of 2 tabs that should be animated, and unlimited maximum. 
  At this demo maximum tabs is 6, but the code lets you to add tabs as much as you want. 

  This is the mobile version of the project. 

Enjoy
