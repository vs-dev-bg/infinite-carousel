# infinite-carousel
  Desktop version of Infinite-carousel

  This is dummy project which shows infinite slider (carousel) with animations, implemented only with pure css.
  There are no javascript animations. You can select number of tabs that you can move. 
  Then you can move the containers to the left or to the right infinitley.
  The carousel logic is smart, so you can have for example minimum of 2 tabs that should be animated, and unlimited    maximum of tabs. 
  At this demo of maximum tabs is 6, but the code lets you to add tabs as much as you want. 

Enjoy
